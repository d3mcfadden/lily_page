      <p>Since the last time I wrote we have done a lot of fun things.</p>
      <p>First, I lost my tooth this past week! The tooth fairy came and I got a bag of candy and $5!</p>
      <img

      />
      <p>Last Sunday we adopted a new doggie named River! He likes eggs and he likes chicken and rice.</p>
      <p>We took River on a walk and took him to a park and the framers market. River can run very fast!</p>
      <p>Today is Father's day, I made daddy a special card and it is up in the little drawer in the kitchen.</p>
